# first_bot
My first ever robot, PrintedBot (because it was fully 3D printed), made for the Grand Concours Robopoly. Not something people should copy, but it's a memory. It a kit PRisme V2 from [Robopoly](https://robopoly.epfl.ch).

It kinda worked, as can be seen on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/cdno7IGpGWA?t=450). That video also shows what it was built for. Other matches were less of a success. The robot eventually crashed, I am still unsure what the reasons are as I never bothered looking into it (too infuriating). It could be that the batteries got low and caused the linear camera to fail, at that time there was no voltage regulator in the kit, which was fixed on the next version of the kit. One other reason is that as there were many flashes from cameras, it messed with the calibrations. Finally, it is also likely that the linear camera was simply garbage, as it caused many issues in the kit and was eventually replaced during my time as board member.
