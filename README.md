# first_bot
My first ever robot, PrintedBot (because it was fully 3D printed), made for the Grand Concours Robopoly. Not something people should copy, but it's a memory.

It kinda worked, as can be seen on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/cdno7IGpGWA?t=450). That video also shows what it was built for. 



This used a kit PRisme V2 from Robopoly.
